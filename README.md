# italiano
I want to learn italian and PHP. So I started working on a simple dynamic website Where I can save every new italian word that I learn. 
And display some statistics on the words that I learn. And that's what this website does.
It's based on PHP and MySQL as backend technologies.

Unfortunately when I started working on this website I never intended to put it on gitHub so I neglected commenting the code.
